# FCC-tribute-project
This is a tribute page for a person that has all their personal information redacted. 
The project required me to use certain id's tags and an image. But for the fun of it I added silly "redacted" anchors and a "click me" anchor that is difficult to click.
**This is my first ever WEB Dev project**, so I got some more insight on how the structure works and how to better clean up code.
I still struggled with some CSS elements and animating the "click me" part proved quite difficult and still requires some revision (the page bops up and down like crazy with certain viewport widths) But overall I think I did alright.
